# Deep-Q-Agent
By porting the code from my NeuralNetwork package to processing I was able to use it to implement [Deep Q Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning#Deep_Q-learning)
to successfully train an agent to play a simple game that I created.

### The game: 
The player is the blue square and must avoid the red squares for up to 30 moves (the max score). Red squares move to the right each turn
and upon reaching the end a column go down a row.
